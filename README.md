This repo contains our work for the CS1.301 Project.

## Idea

We are focusing on a part of Algorithms that deals with the complexity classes of real-life problems that are mathematically modeled. We plan on analyzing real-world problems starting with a game, and modeling it mathematically, and then classify it under a complexity class. If the time permits, we will also try it for other real-world problems.
