<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>We are focusing on a part of Algorithms that deals with the complexity classes of real-life problems that are mathematically modeled. We plan on analyzing real-world problems starting with a game, and modeling it mathematically, and then classify it under a complexity class. If the time permits, we will also try it for other real-world problems.</p>

<h1 id="aim">Aim</h1>

<ul>
  <li>To achieve a better understanding of Complexity Theory.</li>
  <li>To learn how to mathematically model real world problems.</li>
  <li>To understand reduction proofs.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="plan-of-action">Plan of Action</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Studying different complexity classes and papers dealing with the classification of real-world problems into the same.</li>
  <li>Studying different reduction proofs such as the set of Karp’s 21 NP-Complete problems.</li>
  <li>Studying Erik Demaine’s work (<a href="http://erikdemaine.org/papers/Nintendo_FUN2014/paper.pdf">example</a>) on classifying games into different complexity classes.</li>
  <li>Select some video games which haven’t been classified into any complexity classes and try to classify them.</li>
  <li>If time permits, try to classify some other real-world problems into complexity classes.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="results">Results</h1>

<ul>
  <li>A study of reduction proofs of video games (What makes a video game NP-complete)</li>
  <li>A dissertation on the proofs on reduction of the video game that will be classified.</li>
</ul>
