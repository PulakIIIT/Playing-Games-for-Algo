<h2 id="specific-goals">Specific goals</h2>

<ul>
  <li>For each member of the group, we have assigned games which they will understand. Our aim is to classify all the games into complexity classes. Our minimum goal is to classify at least one of the games.</li>
  <li>We split ourselves into groups that will work on different parts of the subject required to achieve the reduction and construct the optimisation algorithm.</li>
  <li>A small group will work on creating the model at the end while the rest work on the construction of the algorithm.</li>
