# Introduction

We are focusing on a part of Algorithms that deals with the complexity classes of real-life problems that are mathematically modeled. We plan on analyzing real-world problems starting with a game, and modeling it mathematically, and then classify it under a complexity class. If the time permits, we will also try it for other real-world problems.

# Aim

- To achieve a better understanding of Complexity Theory.
- To learn how to mathematically model real world problems.
- To understand reduction proofs.

# Plan of Action

- Studying different complexity classes and papers dealing with the classification of real-world problems into the same.
- Studying different reduction proofs such as the set of Karp's 21 NP-Complete problems.
- Studying Erik Demaine's work ([example](http://erikdemaine.org/papers/Nintendo_FUN2014/paper.pdf)) on classifying games into different complexity classes.
- Select some video games which haven't been classified into any complexity classes and try to classify them.
- If time permits, try to classify some other real-world problems into complexity classes.

# Results

- A study of reduction proofs of video games (What makes a video game NP-complete)
- A dissertation on the proofs on reduction of the video game that will be classified.
